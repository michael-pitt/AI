This project includes a list of useful codes for ML tasks. Besides, it contains several notebooks used to exercise the basics of ML.

Outline:
* **[AIcouse](#aicourse)** - jupyter notebook for simple NN
* **[GraphNeuralNetwork](#graphneuralnetwork)** - implementation of GNN for [TrackML](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20112) challenge

## AIcourse
This folder includes few Jupyter notebooks with examples for linear and logistic regression, as well as image categorization using Keras
