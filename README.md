# project AI

This project is under development, and it's includes list of usefull codes for ML tasks. In addition it includes sevelar notebooks used to exersising basics of ML.

Outline:
* **[AIcouse](#aicourse)** - jupyter notebook for simple NN
* **[GraphNeuralNetwork](#graphneuralnetwork)** - implementation of GNN for [TrackML](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20112) challenge

## Aicourse
This folder includes few  jyputer notebooks with simple examples for linear and logistic regression, as well as image categorization using keras
