# CalorimeterSegmentation
This folder contains an implementation of segmentation of calorimeter cells.

In particle calorimetry, segmentation of cell hits concerning different particle types plays a crucial role in various tasks:
 measurement of the energy of jets, particle identification, and localization. 
A few simple approaches are tested here to separate neutral pion from charged pion hits in the detector. 
The detector hits are simulated using Geant4 simulation package with [ATLAS-simplified](https://mpitt82.github.io/Geant4-models/ATLAS-simplified)Â geometry (sampling calorimeter that comprises EM and Had layers).

Example of a few simulation outputs can be found in [ATLAS-simplified@cernbox](https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/oCg3en1GHAvYSTo).
